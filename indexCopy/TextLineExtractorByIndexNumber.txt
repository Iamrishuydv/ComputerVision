This script is for copying a specific line from each text file
in a source folder to a destination folder based on the provided index.

My script takes a source folder containing text files, 
asks for a destination folder, 
and an index number. 
Then, it copies the line which we can say each annotated class at that index from each text file to a new text file in the destination folder. 

It's a handy tool for extracting specific lines from multiple text files.
